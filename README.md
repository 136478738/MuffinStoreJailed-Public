# MuffinStore Jailed

Hacked together on-device App Store client, view it more-so as a PoC than as a final tool.

The UI is a bit scuffed, there's no progress bar during downgrading so just wait on the screen until you get a popup that requests installation ( the time this takes depends on how big the app is, so please wait. ), and then after you press install wait like ~5 more seconds and then you can return to SpringBoard to see the app downgrade being finalized.

I am not responsible for any issues caused by the usage of this tool, it's experimental and I will not be held accountable if anything happens. Use at your own risk. Although nothing should happen, just putting this here just in case.

The app will need to be uninstalled, however, you can preserve app data by offloading the app first, and then downgrading it.
